## Post-Demo Talking Points

**If they ask about:**

1. **"How is this different from DocuSign?"**
   - "DocuSign is for signing. We're for creation, analysis, and compliance. We can integrate with DocuSign."

2. **"What about existing legal tech?"**
   - "Legacy CLM tools lack AI and have zero Islamic finance support. We're AI-native and Shariah-aware from day one."

3. **"Is the AI accurate?"**
   - "Our clause suggestions have 95%+ confidence. We show confidence scores for transparency, and legal teams make final decisions."

4. **"What's your business model?"**
   - "SaaS subscription: $50/user/month for SMBs, enterprise pricing for large firms. Blockchain verification is $5 per contract."

5. **"Who are your customers?"**
   - "Legal teams, compliance officers, Islamic banks, real estate firms, corporate legal departments."

6. **"What's your traction?"**
   - "This is our MVP. We're in conversations with [name Islamic bank] and [name law firm]."

7. **"Can it handle Arabic?"**
   - "On our roadmap. Platform is built for i18n, Arabic UI coming in Q2."
